Description: When you press the h button on your keyboard, you get a lower-case 
    h. But what if you want an upper-case h? Easy! Just go to the wikipedia page 
    on horses, copy the upper-case h and paste it into your document. The 'Hr'
    package provides an RStudio addin that does just that.
